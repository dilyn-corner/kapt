Kapt - A KISS fork utilizing dpkg and apt
________________________________________________________________________________

This repository provides a fork of KISS Linux utilizing Apt and Dpkg for package
management. It is a binary-based fork, with all packages built by me.

Packages are built on my own machine with some minimal optimization flags,
signed and distributed via a secure repository at https://deb.kisscommunity.org.

Important usage information and keys will be made available soon(tm).
