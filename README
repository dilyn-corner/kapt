Kapt - A KISS fork utilizing dpkg & apt
________________________________________________________________________________

This repository provides a fork of KISS Linux utilizing apt & dpkg for package
management. It is a binary-based fork, with all packages built by me.

This fork is initially intended to be a near one-to-one clone of KISS. However,
this is subject to change in the future. Potentially more architectures,
potentially more packages, potentially different rules.

This repository will house the packages required to get started with apt & dpkg.
Additionally, it will be the home of whatever root filesystems end up getting
published. The first release, 2021.12, is to be considered an alpha. It is meant
for toying around, testing, and for gathering feedback ONLY. Do not use in
production, please :)

All packages in the official KISS repository (https://github.com/kisslinux/repo)
will be housed at https://deb.kisscommunity.org

Packages are built on my own machine with some minimal optimization flags and
distributed via a secure repository.
C{XX}FLAGS=-march=x86_64 -mtune=generic -O2 -pipe

The key used to sign the repository and the packages distributed from there is
packaged in kapt-keyring.

If you would like to help build and maintain packages (for amd64 or other
architectures), please let me know and I can look into how to make that a simple
and easy process!

!!!Still currently a WIP, use at your own risk!!!
